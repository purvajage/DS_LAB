# Practical 2 - Linear Regression for Predictive Modeling

This repository contains implementations and evaluations of **Linear Regression** using Python across multiple real-world datasets. The objective is to understand how independent variables (features) influence a dependent variable (target), and how to model and predict outcomes using a linear approach.

---

## 📌 Objective

To implement and evaluate Linear Regression for predictive modeling and to analyze the relationship between independent and dependent variables using various datasets.
