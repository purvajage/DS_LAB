# Practical 1 - Data Preprocessing in Python

## 🎯 Objective
To preprocess (Imputation, Label Encoding, and Data Cleaning) and prepare data using NumPy and Pandas in Python for effective analysis and modeling.

This practical focuses on cleaning and transforming real-world datasets to ensure they are ready for machine learning and statistical analysis.
